This project is to demonstrate my abilities to make a fully featured website that's connected to a SQL database. This meeting planner site has all the tools to schedule meetings and choose the room to have them in. 

For this site SQLite was chosen to make it portable enough to display on Github; though this can easily be integrated into on network SQL database.

## Running the Project

```
git clone https://github.com/Eliya-G/meeting-site
```
In the repo run these commands individually.

```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
pipenv shell
python3 manage.py runserver
```
The final command opens a development server to view the site on your network.
