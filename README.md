This project is to demonstrate my abilities to make a fully featured website that's connected to a SQL database. For this site SQLite was chosen to make it portible enough to display on Github.

## Running the Project

```
git clone https://github.com/Eliya-G/meeting-site
```
In the repo run these commands
```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
pipenv shell
python3 manage.py runserver
```
